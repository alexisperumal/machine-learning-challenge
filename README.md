UCSD Data Science Bootcamp - ML Project

### Objective
• Analyze the provided exoplanet database and develop a classifier model to identify potential exoplanets into one of three categories: Candidate, False Positive, and Confirmed.

### Approach
• Separate the dataset into a training and test sets, select features, run models on scaled data, do hyperparameter optimization and further feature engineering, then propose a model.

### Key Files
• Model_x_compare.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook running several models, generally with default parameters, on the groomed dataset.

• Model_4_random_forest.ipynb - Optimal model of 4 tried, random forest, with tuned parameters.

• alexis-random-forest.sav - model file of the tuned random forest.
